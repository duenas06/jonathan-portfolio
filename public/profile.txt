Hi I am Jonathan Tribiana from Philippines. Since my college days in Fine Arts I’m inspired by the paintings of the old masters. This is what I strive to recreate in my own work; to better my understanding and pass the knowledge on.

I have been a professional Artist for the last 17 years. It’s all I do. It’s been an amazing ride and has taken me around the world. I was born in the United States and moved to Australia when I was 10 years old. I stayed in Australia for 20+ years where I studied my craft. My career began in Perth, Western Australia. In the years that followed my first solo exhibition in 2002, I have enjoyed exhibiting my work and painting for clients internationally.
